    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I don't have a lot of cool hobbies as I am mostly indoors but here they are anyways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><h2> Music: My number one hobby, My Saviour</h2></li>
        <li><h2>Movies & TV Series</h2></li>
        <li><h2>Video games: FC & Mortak Kombat</h2></li>
        <li><h2>I also like watching Football. PS: Ronaldo is my GOAT</h2></li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <p>That will be all for now. <br/> I am hoping to receive my ICA contract in July 2025. When that happens
        I plan to start gyming and take swimming lessons as well as paino lessons. So remember me in your prayers. There 
        is alot at stake with this ICA contract. I am no longer staying with my dad. It has been difficult so far as I have always struggled to 
        manage my finances. I won't blow through my ICA contract earnings but I greatly need the boost in income to
        enable me leave more freely, So Help Me GOD.</p>
